# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The world is becoming so advanced with new technologies everyday. It has terrified me for years because it's something I do not understand.
I want to challenge myself by learning how to code so I can understand computers. So I created this to help me take notes throughout the bootcamp.
There is a section on HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Git.
